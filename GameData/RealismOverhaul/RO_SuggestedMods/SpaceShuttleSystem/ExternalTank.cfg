	@description = External Tank used on the Space Shuttle. The Standard Weight Tank (SWT) was fabricated from 2219 Aluminum-Copper Alloy. The Super Lightweight Tank (SLWT) was first flown in 1998. It was the same design as the LWT, but it used an Aluminum-Lithium alloy that saved more mass. The SLWT provided the needed performance increase for the Shuttle to launch the components of the ISS.
